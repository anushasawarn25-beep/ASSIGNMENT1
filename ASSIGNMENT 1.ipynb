Easy to Learn and Use\n","One of Python’s biggest strengths is its simplicity. The language uses clear, readable syntax that resembles plain English. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced coder, Python makes it easy to write and understand code.\n",". Rich Library\n","One of the reasons Python is so powerful is its extensive library ecosystem. There’s a library for almost any task you can think of. These libraries save you time by providing pre-built code you can integrate into your projects.\n",". Portability and Cross-Platform Support\n","Python works seamlessly on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can write a Python script on one platform and run it on another with minimal or no changes. This cross-platform compatibility makes Python an excellent choice for projects that need to work across multiple environments.\n",". Excellent for Data Science and AI\n","Python is the leading language for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

It is also called translator in programming terminology. Interpreters executes each line of statements slowly. This process is called Interpretation. For example Python is an interpreted language, PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript.An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code by translating it into machine-readable instructions line by line. It serves as the environment where Python scripts are run and processed.\n","\n","Key Features of the Python Interpreter:\n","Line-by-Line Execution: The interpreter reads and executes each line of code sequentially, making it easier to debug and test code.\n","Interactive Environment: You can use the interpreter interactively (e.g., in the Python shell or REPL) to execute commands and see results immediately.\n","Translation Role: It converts high-level Python code into intermediate or machine-level code that the computer can understand.\n","This process is called interpretation, and it allows Python to be a highly flexible and user-friendly programming language.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vS01EzXIbW5a"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3 What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n"," Keywords in Python are special reserved words that are part of the language itself. They define the rules and structure of Python programs, which means you cannot use them as names for your variables, functions, classes, or any other identifiers.These keywords are always available in Python, which means you don’t need to import them.

Python objects are broadly classified into two categories based on this characteristic:\n","Mutable objects: Their contents can be modified after creation.\n","Immutable objects: Once created, their content cannot be altered.\n","Mutable Objects\n","These objects allow you to change their contents without creating a new object. Common mutable types include:\n","Lists (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n","Dictionaries (e.g., {'key': 'value'})\n","Sets (e.g., {1, 2, 3})\n","\n","Immutable Objects\n","These objects cannot be changed once created. Attempting to change them results in the creation of a new object rather than modifying the existing one.

This makes them ideal for cases where your data needs to evolve over time. On the other hand, tuples are meant to hold data that shouldn’t change once it’s been created. Because of this, tuples are immutable, meaning you can’t alter their contents after making them.\n","Here’s why Python makes this distinction:\n","Different Purposes\n","Lists serve as containers you can easily update, grow, or shrink. Tuples are like fixed records — perfect when you want to guarantee the data stays the same throughout your program, like coordinates or configuration settings.\n","How They’re Built Under the Hood\n","Lists are implemented as dynamic arrays with extra space set aside to handle changes efficiently. Tuples, by contrast, are fixed in size and simpler. This makes tuples faster and more memory-friendly.\n","Hashing and Usage as Dictionary Keys\n","Because tuples never change, they can be safely used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets.

Their primary purpose is to allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to True or False.\n","What Are Conditional Statements?\n","In Python, the common conditional statements are if, elif (short for else if), and else. These statements enable branching logic:\n","if: Checks a condition.
